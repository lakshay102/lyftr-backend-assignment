You are helping build a production-style FastAPI backend exactly matching
the "Lyftr AI — Backend Assignment".

STRICT RULES:
1. Follow the provided folder structure EXACTLY.
2. Do NOT add extra features or endpoints.
3. Do NOT change endpoint semantics or response shapes.
4. SQLite ONLY. No ORM. No external services.
5. Configuration ONLY via environment variables.
6. Favor simplicity over cleverness.
7. All code must be deterministic and evaluator-friendly.
8. No logic until explicitly requested.

We will work PHASE BY PHASE.
In each phase:
- Only implement what the phase asks.
- Do NOT anticipate future phases.

If something is ambiguous:
- Follow the assignment spec literally.
